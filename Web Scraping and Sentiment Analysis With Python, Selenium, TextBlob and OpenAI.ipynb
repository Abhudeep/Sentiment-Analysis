    "# Step 1 — Web Scrape to Get Reviews\n",
    "We need to perform web scraping to get User Reviews on IMDb. Beautiful Soup and Selenium can be used for this task. In case you ask, below is a brief introduction about these two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beautiful Soup** is a Python library that is primarily used for parsing and extracting data from HTML and XML documents. It provides a simple and intuitive interface to navigate and search the parse tree created from the document.\n",
    "- **Selenium** is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It provides a browser automation framework that allows you to control web browsers programmatically. Selenium enables tasks such as simulating user interactions, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and navigating through web pages."

    "- The second option is used in this post. Why? Sentiment analysis algorithms analyze the text to assess whether it conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the sentiment expressed in a review. Sentiment analysis can capture subtle aspects of the text and provide insights beyond just an overall rating. It can help identify positive reviews that might have lower ratings due to specific reasons or negative reviews that mention positive aspects.\n",
